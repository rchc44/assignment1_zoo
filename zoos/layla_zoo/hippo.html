      Higgos are the third largest mammal on earth typically weighing between 3,000 to almost 10,000 pounds. They usually measure 6 to 16 feet long. Hippos are very good at swimming and can hold their breaths up to an average of 5 minutes. 
      Hippos are herbivores eat more than 50 pounds of grass each night. Hippos produce their own sunblock to protect them the heat in places such as Saharan Africa.
