      Tiger are the kings of the jungle and have over 100 stripes each being unique. Tigers hunt in water and enjoy swimming. There are six different types of tigers: Bengal , Sumatran, Indochinese , Siberian and South China.

      Tigers are endangered species and are constantly hunted for meat and body parts. Their homes are often destroyed , contributing to their endangerment.
