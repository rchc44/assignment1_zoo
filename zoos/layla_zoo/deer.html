      Deers are located on all continents except Antartica . They can live in various types of habitats such as the mountains or the rain forest. 
      All types of deers have antlers and annually they fall off and regrow . During the winter , deers are not that active due to limited amount of food. 
      Deer tend to move around where there is food availibility. Most deers shades are light brown to medium brown.
