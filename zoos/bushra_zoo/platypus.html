      The platypus, sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic,
       egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus is the sole living
      representative or monotypic taxon of its family and genus, though a number of related species
      appear in the fossil record.
