    The platypus, sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania.
	The platypus is the sole living representative or monotypic taxon of its family and genus, though a number of related species appear in the fossil record.
